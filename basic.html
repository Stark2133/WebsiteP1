<h2>Yeagerists</h2>
</center>
<p><em>The Yeagerists are a faction from the anime and manga series Attack on Titan. Their members consist of former Survey Corps, Garrison, and Military Police figures who swore loyalty to Eren Yeager, believing him to be the savior of Eldia - specifically Paradis Island - though some members only serve out of fear of retribution. They were rallied by Floch Forster during the years 853 and 854 in Eren's behalf. They serve as the central antagonistic faction of the War for Paradis arc and Season 4. <strong>If you want to become Yeagerist and join the side of Eren Yeager <a href="file.html">click here </strong></a></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Everything that you thought had meaning: every hope, dream, or moment of happiness. None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield. None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body, we all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?... They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them! And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAAAAAGE!
