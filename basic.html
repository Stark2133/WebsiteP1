<h2>YEAGERIST</h2>
</center>
<p><em>The Yeagerists are a faction from the anime and manga series Attack on Titan. Their members consist of former Survey Corps, Garrison, and Military Police figures who swore loyalty to Eren Yeager, believing him to be the savior of Eldia - specifically Paradis Island - though some members only serve out of fear of retribution. They were rallied by Floch Forster during the years 853 and 854 in Eren's behalf. They serve as the central antagonistic faction of the War for Paradis arc and Season 4. <strong>If you want to become Yeagerist and join the side of Eren Yeager <a href="file.html">click here </strong></a></em></p>
